By the very first moment, that you sign up to [repsy](https://respy.io). You have one private/public repository called `default`. The only thing that you should make for creating your first repository is just singing up to [repsy](https://respy.io).

If you need more than one repositories, you can create as many as you want and make them private or public regarding on your project needs.
