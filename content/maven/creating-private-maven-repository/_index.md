By the very first moment, that you sign up to [repsy](https://respy.io). You have one private/public repository called `default` and it's private repository from the very first moment you've created your account.

Your repository password is the same with your account password. You can rename it in your repository page whenever you want. You can make your private maven repository public in your repository page.
